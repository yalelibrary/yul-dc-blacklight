    "The Whitman collection consists of letters, manuscripts, photographs, artwork, and personal papers documenting the life and work of Walt Whitman. There is personal and business correspondence from Whitman to family, friends, editors, and publishers, including Richard Maurice Bucke, John Burroughs, Julius Chambers, Moncure Conway, Nathan Hale, James R. Osgood and Company, George Routledge & Sons, William Sloane Kennedy, William Michael Rossetti, John Swinton, and Louisa Whitman. There are letters to Whitman from Civil War soldiers and from a number of writers, including Samuel Clemens, John Camden Hotten, William Douglas O'Connor, Allen Thorndike Rice, and Algernon Swinburne. There is also a small group of third-party correspondence to Whitman scholar George Rice Carpenter.",
    "Whitman's writings are well represented in the Rabinowitz and Van Sinderen gifts. The Writings subseries in the Van Sinderen gift includes subdivisions for autobiographical writings, diaries, lectures and speeches, notes and notebooks, outlines and proposals, poetry and the writing of others. The writings are present chiefly in galley proofs, many corrected and signed, and holograph manuscripts.",
    "Photographs and artistic representations of Whitman include work by well-known nineteenth century photographers, studios, and artists. There are photographs by Thomas Eakins, William Kurtz, Major & Knapp Engraving, and Brady National Photographic Art Gallery. Works of art include a bust of Whitman by Samuel Murray, a woodcut by Bertrand Zadig, and engravings by Samuel Hollyer, William James Linton, and Stephen Alonzo Schoff. Also of note are papers relating to George Whitman and New York Civil War regiments.",
