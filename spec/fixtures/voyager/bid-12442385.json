    "William F. \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody (1846-1917) was born in Scott County, Iowa Territory, on February 26, 1846, and raised in Leavenworth, Kansas Territory. He was a cattle herder, fur trapper, gold miner, and Pony Express rider before serving as a Union scout during the Civil War, and was periodically called back by the U.S. Army for scouting and other duties through the 1890s. Cody also worked as a buffalo hunter and guide to hunting parties, and in the early 1870s appeared in the stage shows \"Scouts of The Prairie\" and \"Scouts of The Plains.\" In 1883 he organized \"Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show,\" which he toured throughout the United States and Europe for three decades, but eventually lost to creditors. Cody died in Denver, Colorado, on January 10, 1917.",

Cody in 1869, and worked with him as a scout and guide; they also appeared together in the stage shows \"Scouts of The Prairie\" and \"Scouts of The Plains\" in the early 1870s. Omohundro was regularly employed as a guide for European aristocrats who visited the American West to hunt wild game. He died of pneumonia on June 28, 1880, in Leadville, Colorado.",
