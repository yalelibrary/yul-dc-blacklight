# Yale Digital Library Discovery Application

This is one of the microservices applications that form the Yale digital library.

## Development guide

### Prerequisites

- Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and log in

### Docker Development Setup

- Checkout the project
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yalelibrary/yul-dc-blacklight.git
  cd yul-dc-blacklight
  docker-compose pull blacklight
  ```

### Starting the app

- Start the blacklight service and it's dependencies
  This command reads the docker-compose.yml file and starts all the containers described by it
  including blacklight, solr, the manifest service, the management app, and a iiif image server.

  ```bash
  docker-compose up blacklight
  ```

  Output from the blackight container will display in your terminal window with Solr, Cantaloupe (IIIF),
  and Manifest services running in the background

- Access the blacklight app at `http://localhost:3000`

- Access the solr instance at `http://localhost:8983`

- Access the image instance at `http://localhost:8182`

- Access the manifests instance at `http://localhost`

### Accessing the blacklight container

- In a separate terminal window or tab, run:

  ```bash
  docker-compose exec blacklight bash
  ```

- You will need to be inside the container to:

  - Run migrations
  - Run bundle install
  - Access the seed file
  - Access the rails console for debugging

    ```
    bundle exec rails c
    ```

  - Run rubocop

    ```
    bundle exec rubocop -a
    ```

  - Run rspec

    ```
    bundle exec rspec
    ```

  - Rebuild the code documentation

    ```
    bundle exec rake yale:docs:blacklight
    ```

### Indexing data

- First, connect to the running management application:

 * http://localhost:3001/management/

- Second, pull up http://0.0.0.0:8983 in your browser

 * Connect to the blacklight-core and execute a query to confirm no data present

- Then, in the running management application(:3001), click the button 'Index Ladybird Records to Solr'

 * When the message appears above the buttons the data has been indexed

 * Visit :8983 and run the same query again and confirm data is present

 * Connect to the running blacklight app at localhost:3000

## Pulling or Building Docker Images
   Any time you pull a branch with a Gemfile change you need to pull or build a new Docker image. If you change the Dockerfile, you
   need to build a new Docker image. If you change a file in ./ops you need to build a new Docker image. These are the primary
   times in which you need to pull or build.

## When Installing a New Gem
   For the most part images are created and maintained by the CI process. However, if you change the Gemfile you need
   to take a few extra steps.  Make sure the application is running before you make your Gemfile change. Once you've
   updated the Gemfile, inside the container, run `bundle && nginx -s reload`. The next time you stop your running containers
   you need to rebuild.

## HTTP password protection

In order to prevent search engine crawling of the system before it's ready to launch, we use HTTP password protection. This is set via environment variables. Set `HTTP_PASSWORD_PROTECT='true'` to enable this feature. Set `HTTP_PASSWORD_PROTECT='false'` to disable this feature. Set the login and password via environment variables `HTTP_USERNAME` and `HTTP_PASSWORD` in the .secrets file

## Secrets

For the image instance to properly access images, you must also create a .secrets file with valid S3 credentials and basic auth credentials; see secrets-template for the correct format.

## Releasing a new version

1. Decide on a new version number. We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
2. Update the version number in `.github_changelog_generator`
3. github_changelog_generator --user yalelibrary --project yul-dc-blacklight --token $YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
4. Commit and merge the changes you just made.
5. Once those changes are merged to the `master` branch, in the github web UI go to `Releases` and tag a new release with the right version number. Paste in the release notes for this version from the changelog you generated. In the release notes, split out `Features`, `Bug Fixes`, and `Other`
6. Once the CI build has completed for `master`, tag and push a docker hub image with the same release number:

  ```
  docker pull yalelibraryit/dc-blacklight:f93089f70e18d6c6d77ee1a6b3b4866b6d284078 <-- the tag created by circleci
  docker tag yalelibraryit/dc-blacklight:f93089f70e18d6c6d77ee1a6b3b4866b6d284078 yalelibraryit/dc-blacklight:v1.2.1 <-- the new, semantically versioned tag
  docker push yalelibraryit/dc-blacklight:v1.2.1 <-- now our semantically versioned tag will be available from docker hub
  ```

7. Update `yul-dc-camerata` with the new version of blacklight and submit a PR.

## Using a New Release of the Management App or other microservices

1. Go to the yul-dc-camerata repository on Github and check the latest release number in the [.env file.](https://github.com/yalelibrary/yul-dc-camerata/blob/master/.env)

2. Edit your .env file to match

3. Run ```docker-compose up blacklight```
